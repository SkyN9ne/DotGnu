Mono's System.Xml.dll
=====================

This is build directory for mono's "System.Xml.dll" library. Pnet has it's own
"System.Xml.dll" but you may prefer using library built from mono sources.

We build and install library "System.XmlMono.dll" by default. You can use this
library in your program by referencing "System.XmlMono.dll" instead of
"System.Xml.dll".

If you wish to replace pnet's "System.Xml.dll" system-wide do:

# ilgac --install --force class/System.XML/System.Xml.dll

There is also plan to replace System.Xml.dll in pnet with this mono
implementation. In this case we still use ml-pnet for updating System.Xml in
pnetlib, because ml-pnet has infrastructure to build autogenerated .cs files.
