Mono Libraries for Portable.NET
-------------------------------

This distribution contains a number of build scripts for building some
of the Mono class libraries and utility programs with Portable.NET's
C# compiler, so that they can be installed and used with Portable.NET's
runtime engine.

If you are building this from CVS, you will need a copy of the Mono library 
source tree (CVS module "mcs"), because the CVS distribution does not contain 
the Mono sources.  See "www.go-mono.com" for details on obtaining the Mono 
library source.

Once you have the Mono library source, configure and build as follows:

	./configure --with-mono-sources=../mono/mcs
	make
	make install

where "../mono/mcs" is the path on your system to the "mcs" directory within
the Mono source distribution.  This directory will typically contain a
"class" subdirectory, under which the Mono library sources may be found.

By default, the libraries will be installed in ${prefix}/lib/cscc/lib,
where the other pnetlib libraries are installed.  This location should
not conflict with a Mono installation if you have one on your system.

Not all Mono libraries are built.  In particular, the Portable.NET
counterparts to "corlib", "System", and "System.Xml" are used instead
of the Mono versions.  Some other libraries may not be built yet
because of missing features or bugs in Portable.NET or pnetlib, which
we are working on.  Contributions are welcome. It is possible to build
and use "System.Xml" from mono. See "class/System.XML/README" for more
info.

Bug reports, contributions, offers of help, etc, should be addressed
to the Portable.NET developers mailing list, "pnet-developers@dotgnu.org".

The build scripts are distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (see "COPYING" for details), but the Mono source and
resulting binaries are under different licenses.  Consult the Mono
source distribution for details.
